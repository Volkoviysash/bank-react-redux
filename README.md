<h2>About the project</h2>

  <p>
In this application, I learned how to make queries, this app fetch users from the server, and they are displayed in the block. Also there is a simple counter component that simulates your bank account, you can add money or cash out money, and it will display your current balance. There is another block with users that also receives data asynchronously from the server. Overall, this app seems like a valuable resource for those who want to learn more about async actions. In this project, I emphasized functionality over design, so it may seem boring.
